Infix to Postfix Converter
This project implements an Infix to Postfix conversion algorithm using the Shunting Yard algorithm. It takes a mathematical expression in infix notation (e.g., A + B * C) and converts it into postfix notation (e.g., A B C * +). The program supports *operators (+, -, , /, ^), parentheses, and precedence rules.

ðŸš€ Features:

Converts infix expressions to postfix notation
Handles operator precedence and parentheses
Supports multiple arithmetic operators
Simple and efficient stack-based approach
